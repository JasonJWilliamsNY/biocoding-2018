    "## Making a hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping up what we have discussed so far, we can introduce a more familiar - the Hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia a [Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) is a proposed explination about some phenomenon. A hypothesis is by no means a guess, but should be a reasonable argument that explains why something occurrs. That last definition 'reasonable argument' is probably specious (what is 'reasonable'?), but maybe it will direct us to examine how a scientist might think about a hypothsis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, a scientist not only needs to think about reasonable evidence, but needs to express this in a quantitative (yes, qualitative too) manner; hence statistics. A basic statistical approach is to use something called the null hyothesis: **H<sub>0</sub>**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A null hypothesis is what it sounds like - it is a hypothesis that assumes there is no affect or no difference. For example, rather than ask the question, does *Drug X* work? we simply assume that *Drug X* does not work, and then try to prove that hypothesis. In some ways we can think of this as 'not getting our hopes up.' We try to prove that and effect or phenomenon is not real (also see the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle)). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking about error\n",
    "\n",
    "When we evaluate our null hypothesis, we end of making a decision - do we reject or accept the null hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",

    "**H<sub>0</sub>**: The 10th grade class of Central has an average hight that is identical to the hight of students at all NYC high schools. \n"

In our case, only two: Male or Female. We take our number of choices (n), and always subtract 1, to give us **'df'**, our 'degrees of freedom'. Now we can take the 0.02 value to the Chi-squared [chart](https://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/tbl-chi.html). According to this chart with df = 1, the 0.002 value lies somewhere between 0.9 and 0.1. These values are (for our purposes today) probabilities (our chances) that we if we reject our null hypothesis we would be correct. For example, if our probability (p) was 0.5 = rejecting the null, would be right half the time. If our probability (p) was 0.05, we would be right 95% of the time. We will talk more about this later, but let's try an example with our M&Ms "
