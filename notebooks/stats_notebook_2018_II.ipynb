    "As it turns out, when we make observations about our data (counting M&M colors, measuring student hights, taking blood pressure reading) we often come across something called the [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (pictured above). There are several special values and terms, but put very simply, the normal distribution tells us that most of our samples should be about average (that's what average means right). The idea that most things of the same type (students in the same school/grade, cars being made at a factory, etc.) should have lots of similarities. Sometimes (in the case of cars) the individual members of a population should be nearly identical - it would not be good bussiness if a every 5th car assembled was a junker. Although (adult) rabbits might look largely the same to you as a population they do vary (have more [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)), but still they are largely average. \n",
