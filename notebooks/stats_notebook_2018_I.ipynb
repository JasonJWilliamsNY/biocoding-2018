If you go back to your notes, you should find one of our first reading assignments [What is This Thing Called Science](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2015/blob/master/pdfs/what_is_science.pdf). It's strongly suggested that you go back to read this material, having made it this far in the course. After having taken a lot of time to understand some important scientific techniques, we are now going to start looking into some of the more quantitative aspects of the scientific endeavor. "
